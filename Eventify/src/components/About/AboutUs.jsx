            <h2>Join Our Team</h2>
            <p>
              We believe that even though we're so often communicating and
              socialising online, itâ€™s those offline weddings, social and
              corporate events and activities that are most important. So we are
              starting off by making it easier for people to organise offline
              weddings, social and corporate events and find venues, artists,
              decorators, entertainers etc. for the same. What we have created
              is a web-based venue and vendor discovery platform that links
              event-organisers with the best function venues and vendors across
              India. If you want to contribute towards our big hairy audacious
              goal to make it easier for Indians to create social experiences,
              you should definitely join us! You can send in your resume at:
